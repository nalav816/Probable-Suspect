# Probable-Suspect
  In Probable Suspect, following a murder, the player attains randomized clues through interrogating procedurally generated witnesses. Given these clues, the player is then tasked with choosing the correct suspect. 
Though the lack of a game engine wasn’t ideal for the game’s scope, it has provided the opportunity to engage with and understand technologies often taken for granted, such as collision detection. In addition to those mentioned earlier, this game uses a variety of systems, including but not limited to branching character dialogue, event-driven gameplay, multithreading, and UI interpolation. 
## Game Features
1) 24 enemy aliens with randomized shot patterns. Beware of the aliens in the middle row! They are more deadly.
2) Power-ups from killing enemies. Watch your firerate, movement speed, and bullet velocity ramp up as you take down aliens.
3) Six barricades to help defend against the initial onslaught of bullets. 
## How to run
1) Clone this repository
2) Run the main method in src/App.java
## Roadmap
1) Finish polishing up the game. Add more interpolation effects, like dialogue indicator bounce.
2) Add audio.
3) Finish dialogue lines.
